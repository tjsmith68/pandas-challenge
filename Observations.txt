Brief Summary of Observations

When looking at math and reading scores by grade it appears that there is no appreciable difference across grades.

If you look at per student budget, it initially appears that there is an inverse relationship between spending and 
performance. This could be misleading. It seems clear when looking at student performance by school type that Charter schools
out perform District schools by a wide margin while consistently spending less per student. This suggests that Charter 
schools are more efficient at allocating funds for student performance. However, this may or may not be the case. 
There could be a lurking variable creating this observation (Charter schools can be more selective of their students 
possibly) In order to draw a meaningful conclusion about the correlation between spending and student performance, 
the data should be analyzed independantly for each school type.
